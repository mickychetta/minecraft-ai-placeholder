## Summary
 The Nether Portal Creator will use Reinforcement Learning to craft a Nether Portal in Malmo (Minecraft). The Minecraft character Steve will spawn with the necessary tools (Diamond Pickaxe & Flint and Steel) to mine Obsidian blocks and craft a Nether Portal.  We will create an environment filled with Lava, Water, Stone, Obsidian, Iron Ores, and Gravel. Steve will need to explore the cave and mine different types of blocks until he acquires 14 Obsidian blocks. After obtaining the necessary blocks, Steven will need to place the blocks accordingly and light it with Flint and Steel to form the Nether Portal.

## AI/ML Algorithm
The Nether Portal Creator will use Reinforcement Learning and Q-Learning to determine how good an action is at a particular state. It will determine how good the blocks are to be mined and the placement of blocks.

## Evaluation Plan
The data we will be evaluating is the possible rewards for the agent’s action. Using our model-based approach enables us to train a dataset through mining and block-placing tasks. In the beginning of the game, the agent will be positioned in the center of the cave generated by the provided XML. The cave will be a 20 by 20 playing field filled with various blocks such as stone, iron ores, lava, water, and obsidian. To evaluate the environment, the agent will be mining from the first point of view downwards as he moves throughout the cave. For each action, the agent will receive a score +50 for mining obsidian and +5 for every other block. The agent will lose 20 points if he touches water or lava. The baseline will be a world that consists of at least 50 obsidian in order to increase the probability of successfully obtaining 14 obsidian blocks. We will reward the agent +100 for placing down the obsidian next to each other following the provided grid. Upon completion of the portal, the agent will receive +1000 points and an additional +1000 after lighting it up with flint and steel. As our agent continues to learn, we will provide more complex environments with limited obsidian to gather larger and accurate datasets. We’ll also be taking time to complete tasks into consideration and penalize longer amounts of time taken by our AI.

There are a few core functions of our AI that are required to successfully craft a nether portal. As part of our qualitative analysis, we will be analyzing our AI’s ability to carry out each of these functions, independently from each other. Those core capabilities include mining the correct amount of obsidian, constructing the frame of the nether portal given the minimum number of obsidian needed, and activating the nether portal given the flint and steel. We will sanity check our AI by creating the optimal environment for each function to see if our AI can perform the function given the correct materials. Conditions for an optimal environment may include having only obsidian blocks available to mine or already having 14 obsidian in inventory.
