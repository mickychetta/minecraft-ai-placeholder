### The Nether Portal Creator will use Reinforcement Learning to craft a Nether Portal in Malmo (Minecraft). The Minecraft character Steve will spawn with the necessary tools (Diamond Pickaxe & Flint and Steel) to mine Obsidian blocks and craft a Nether Portal.  We will create an environment filled with Lava, Water, Stone, Obsidian, Iron Ores, and Gravel. Steve will need to explore the cava and mine the different types of blocks until he acquires 14 Obsidian blocks. After obtaining the necessary blocks, Steven will need to place the blocks accordingly and light it with Flint and Steel to form the Nether Portal.
